What is a QR Code?
==================

A Quick Response code is a two-dimensional pictographic code used for
its fast readability and comparatively large storage capacity. The code
consists of black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white
background. The information encoded can be made up of any kind of data
(e.g., binary, alphanumeric, or Kanji symbols)
